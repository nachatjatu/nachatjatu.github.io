## about me

I am finishing up my M.S. in Management Science and Engineering (MS&E) at <span class="stanford-accent">Stanford</span>, where I also completed my B.S. in Computer Science in 2025.

My research interests lie broadly in the **decision sciences**, particularly in how people respond to incentives and uncertainty in socioeconomic systems. I aim to study these dynamics in operations settings such as **supply chains**, **services**, and **matching platforms**, drawing inspiration from areas such as _dynamic optimization_, _mechanism design_, and _machine learning_.

Some themes that excite me include <span class="stanford-accent">sustainability</span>, <span class="stanford-accent">emerging economies</span>, and <span class="stanford-accent">public-private interfaces</span>.
