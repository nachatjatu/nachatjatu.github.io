I am finishing up my M.S. in Management Science and Engineering (MS&E) at Stanford, where I also completed my B.S. in Computer Science in 2025. 

My research interests lie broadly in the decision sciences, where I aim to study how people respond to incentives and uncertainty in socioeconomic systems. I am especially interested in using tools from optimization and game theory to understand how these dynamics manifest in operations settings such as supply chains, transportation, and matching platforms. Some themes that excite me include sustainability, emerging economies, public-private interfaces, and human-algorithm interactions.

Growing up in Bangkok, I am an origami folder, aviation geek, and (surprisingly) a fan of American football.
